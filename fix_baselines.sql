-- Fix baseline values that were captured AFTER deposits instead of BEFORE
-- Baseline should represent balance BEFORE the transaction

-- Fix DT's $5,000 deposit (Oct 28)
-- Current: 4213.66, but if this includes the deposit, it should be: 4213.66 - 5000 = -786.34 (impossible)
-- So this one might be correct, or the account was genuinely at $4213.66 before deposit

-- Fix K's $5,000 deposit (Oct 30)
-- Current: 14505.87 (includes the deposit)
-- Should be: 14505.87 - 5000 = 9505.87 (balance before K's deposit)
