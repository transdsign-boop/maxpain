## What is Liquidation Hunting?

### The Opportunity

When leveraged traders get liquidated, their positions are forcefully closed at market price, creating temporary price dislocations. These events often cause:

- **Oversold/Overbought Conditions**: Forced selling/buying creates price extremes
- **Liquidity Cascades**: One liquidation can trigger others, amplifying moves
- **Mean Reversion Opportunities**: Prices typically revert after liquidation pressure subsides

### Our Approach

The MPI™ Liquidation Hunter Bot:

1. **Monitors** real-time liquidation streams from Aster DEX
2. **Analyzes** cascade risk and market microstructure
3. **Identifies** high-quality reversal opportunities
4. **Executes** counter-trend positions with precision
5. **Manages** risk through dynamic DCA and protective stops

**Strategy**: When long positions get liquidated (selling pressure) → We go LONG (buy the dip). When short positions get liquidated (buying pressure) → We go SHORT (sell the rally).

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Liquidation Detection

**Intelligent Signal Processing:**
- WebSocket connection to Aster DEX liquidation stream
- Configurable percentile thresholds (1st-99th percentile)
- Symbol-specific monitoring across 18+ crypto pairs
- Lookback window analysis (1-24 hours)
- Duplicate liquidation filtering

**Cascade Risk Analysis:**
- **LQ Score**: Liquidation quantity vs. median (scale: 0-∞)
- **RET Score**: Realized volatility indicator (scale: 0-∞)
- **OI Delta**: Open interest changes (1min & 3min windows)
- **Reversal Quality**: 4-tier system (Poor → OK → Good → Excellent)
- **Auto-Block**: Prevents trading during extreme cascade events

### 2. Advanced DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) System

**Mathematical Framework:**

The bot uses a sophisticated DCA system with:

- **Volatility Scaling**: Layer distances adapt to ATR (Average True Range)
  - Formula: `ck = Δ1 × k^p × max(1, ATR/Vref)`
  - Δ1 = Starting step distance (e.g., 0.4%)
  - p = Convexity factor (e.g., 1.2) for widening spacing
  - Vref = Reference volatility baseline

- **Exponential Size Growth**: Each layer grows geometrically
  - Formula: `wk = g^(k-1)` where g = growth ratio (e.g., 1.8x)
  - Ensures winning positions scale appropriately

- **Dynamic Exit Pricing**:
  - Take Profit: Volatility-adjusted distance with exit cushion
  - Stop Loss: Calculated from weighted average entry price
  - Auto-updates after each layer fill

- **Risk-Aware Sizing**: Total position risk capped at configurable % of account

**Configuration Parameters:**
- Start Step (0.1-5%): First layer distance from entry
- Spacing Convexity (1.0-3.0): How quickly layers widen
- Size Growth (1.0-3.0): Exponential multiplier per layer
- Max Risk (1-20%): Total portfolio risk limit
- Volatility Reference (0.1-5%): Baseline for ATR scaling
- Exit Cushion (0.1-2.0): Take profit distance multiplier
- Max Layers (1-10): Maximum position additions

### 3. Portfolio Risk Management

**Multi-Layer Protection:**

**Position Limits:**
- Max open positions (0-20, 0 = unlimited)
- Max portfolio risk percentage (1-100%)
- Configurable margin allocation (1-100% of account)
- Per-trade leverage control (1-125x)

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Live calculation of total portfolio exposure
- Position-level unrealized P&L tracking
- Funding cost tracking for perpetual futures
- Automatic position limit enforcement

**Emergency Controls:**
- One-click "Close All Positions" button
- Strategy pause/resume without full deactivation
- Live session stop (preserves all historical data)

### 4. Intelligent Order Execution

**Smart Order Placement:**
- **Price Chase Mode**: Auto-adjusts limit prices during rapid moves
- **Order Delay**: Configurable wait time (100ms-30s) before execution
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Max acceptable price deviation (0.1-5%)
- **Retry Duration**: Max time to chase price (5s-5min)
- **Order Types**: Market or Limit orders

**Order Management:**
- Batch order execution for efficiency
- Idempotent order placement (prevents duplicates)
- Atomic cancel-and-replace for TP/SL updates

## Trading Strategy

### Entry Logic

**Signal Requirements (ALL must be met):**

1. ✅ **Asset Filter**: Symbol must be in selected assets list
2. ✅ **Percentile Threshold**: Liquidation size ≥ configured percentile (e.g., top 10%)
3. ✅ **Cascade Risk**: Reversal quality meets minimum threshold for volatility regime
   - Low volatility: RQ ≥ 1 (accepts "poor" quality)
   - Medium volatility: RQ ≥ 2 (requires "ok" quality)
   - High volatility: RQ ≥ 3 (requires "good" quality)
4. ✅ **Portfolio Limits**: Not at max position count or risk limit
5. ✅ **Cooldown Cleared**: No recent entry for same symbol (prevents spam)

**Entry Execution:**
1. Calculate ATR-based volatility
2. Compute DCA levels and initial position size
3. Verify total risk < max portfolio risk
4. Place market/limit order at liquidation price
5. Set protective TP/SL orders immediately
6. Store position with DCA parameters for future layers

### Layer Addition Logic

**When to Add Layers:**
- New liquidation detected for same symbol
- Price has moved against position (DCA trigger)
- Current layer count < max layers
- Additional risk < portfolio risk limit

**Layer Execution:**
1. Retrieve initial entry price (P0) and base size (q1) from database
2. Calculate next layer price using convex spacing formula
3. Compute layer size using exponential growth
4. Verify new layer risk + existing risk < max portfolio risk
5. Place layer order
6. Recalculate weighted average entry price
7. Update TP/SL orders to reflect new position

### Exit Logic

**Take Profit:**
- Calculated using volatility-adjusted distance
- Formula: `TP = avgEntry × (1 + volatilityMultiplier × exitCushion × tpPercent / 100)`
- Auto-updates after each layer

**Stop Loss:**
- Fixed percentage from weighted average entry
- Conservative protection (typical: 2-5%)
- Auto-updates after each layer

**Manual Exit:**
- Close individual positions via UI
- Close all positions (emergency stop)
- Automatic closure on TP/SL trigger
